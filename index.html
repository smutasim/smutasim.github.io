            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I work in the aerospace industry, driven by a deep passion for space exploration and the engineering challenges involved in expanding humanity's reach beyond Earth. 
                What excites me the most is the potential to develop technologies that enable long-duration space missions, ensure safe spaceflight for all, and promote the science 
                of tomorrow. These advances not only push the boundaries of exploration but also inspire innovation that can make life better here on Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond space, I am deeply interested in sustainability and ecology. If we cannot take care of Earth, why do we deserve the rest of the 
                Solar System? I believe that the same creativity and problem-solving skills applied to space engineering should also be used to address urgent challenges like 
                climate change and preserving ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of my background in software, I mostly work on programs to model complex systems, simulate real-world conditions, and create visualizations that help 
                communicate difficult engineering concepts clearly and engagingly. Working on projects that are both practical and inspiring gives me a strong sense of purpose. 
                This is what motivates me every day - the desire to contribute to a future where humanity thrives both on Earth and beyond. Thanks for visiting this page, I hope
                some of this work sparks curiosity! And feel free to reach out directly.
